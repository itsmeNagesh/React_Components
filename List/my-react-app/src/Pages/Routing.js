        <h3>Routes are perhaps the most important part of a React Router app. They couple URL segments to components, data loading and data mutations. Through route nesting, complex application layouts and data dependencies become simple and declarative.</h3>
        <h1>Picking Router</h1>
        <h3>While your app will only use a single router, several routers are available depending on the environment your app is running in. This document should help you figure out which one to use.
          <h1>Create BrowserRouter</h1>
          <h3>This is the recommended router for all React Router web projects. It uses the DOM History API to update the URL and manage the history stack.

It also enables the v6.4 data APIs like loaders, actions, fetchers and more.
